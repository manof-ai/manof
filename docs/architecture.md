# Manof Architecture

## Overview

Manof is built with a modular architecture that combines AI capabilities with Solana blockchain integration. The system is designed to be scalable, secure, and efficient in processing smart contract interactions.

## Core Components

### 1. Smart Contract Layer

The Solana program (smart contract) layer consists of several key components:

```
program/
├── src/
│   ├── lib.rs           # Main contract logic
│   ├── state.rs         # State management
│   ├── instructions.rs  # Contract instructions
│   └── errors.rs        # Custom error types
└── tests/               # Contract tests
```

### 2. AI Processing Engine

The AI layer is responsible for analyzing and optimizing contract interactions:

```
ai/
├── models/
│   ├── contract_analyzer.py
│   ├── optimization_engine.py
│   └── security_monitor.py
├── training/
│   └── model_training.py
└── inference/
    └── prediction_engine.py
```

### 3. Client Integration Layer

Provides interfaces for external applications to interact with Manof:

```
app/
├── src/
│   ├── client.ts
│   ├── types.ts
│   └── utils.ts
└── tests/
    └── integration_tests.ts
```

## System Flow

1. **Contract Analysis**
   - Input: Smart contract bytecode/source
   - Process: AI model analyzes contract structure
   - Output: Security assessment, optimization suggestions

2. **Transaction Optimization**
   - Input: Transaction parameters
   - Process: Optimization engine determines best execution strategy
   - Output: Optimized transaction parameters

3. **Security Monitoring**
   - Input: Real-time contract interactions
   - Process: Continuous monitoring for suspicious patterns
   - Output: Security alerts and preventive actions

## Security Considerations

1. **Access Control**
   - Role-based permissions
   - Multi-signature requirements
   - Time-locked operations

2. **Data Privacy**
   - Encrypted storage

   - Privacy-preserving computation

3. **Risk Management**
   - Transaction limits
   - Rate limiting
   - Emergency shutdown procedures

## Performance Optimization

1. **Parallel Processing**
   - Multi-threaded analysis
   - Batch processing capabilities
   - Distributed computation support

2. **Caching Strategy**
   - In-memory caching
   - Persistent storage optimization
   - Cache invalidation policies

3. **Resource Management**
   - Dynamic resource allocation
   - Load balancing
   - Automatic scaling

## Future Extensibility

The architecture is designed to be extensible for future enhancements:

1. **Cross-chain Support**
   - Bridge integration
   - Multi-chain monitoring
   - Cross-chain optimization
